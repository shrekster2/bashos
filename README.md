# BASH-OS
BASH-OS is based on a currently private reopsitory, it is a release converted into bash/shell. 

This version isn't really the main focus, so it may miss some features for a while, before they are ported over.
The recently created runme.sh only works on ubuntu, but if you are on a different distro, you need to install mpg123.

Instructions:

1.Download Bash-OS

2.Extract the file (if needed)

3.Open terminal window in folder and type: sudo bash ./runme.sh and it will install some dependencies

4.Go into the properties of bashos.sh and check "allow executing file as program"

5.Type ./bashos.sh in the terminal window

6.Have fun!

I encourage you to fork this and make it your own!
