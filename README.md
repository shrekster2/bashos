# BASH-OS
## BATCH-OS Clone for Linux
BASH-OS or BATCH-OS for Linux
is based on https://github.com/shrekster2/batch-os, it is a release converted into bash/shell. 

This version isn't really the main focus, so it may miss some features for a while, before they are ported over.
This project isn't even close to the real batch-os right now, but this is a simple proof of concept.
The recently created runme.sh only works on ubuntu, but if you are on a different distro, you need to install mpg123.

Instructions:

1.Download Bash-OS

2.Extract the file (if needed)

3.Open terminal window in folder and type: sudo bash ./runme.sh

It will install some dependencies

4. Go into the properties of bashos.sh and check "allow executing file as program"

5.Type ./bashos.sh in the terminal window

6.Have fun!
